# Weather Forecast - Exam Project

This is my exam application on React, created using Vite.
I use the [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api) API to get:

- Current weather in a city

- 7-day forecast

## Functionality:

- Search for weather by city name

- Choose forecast type (current or 5-day)

- Display data in a convenient way

## Technologies:

- React + Vite
- Custom styles / Bootstrap (optional)

- API requests via fetch

## Running locally:
